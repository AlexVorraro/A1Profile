							<h2>Personal Information</h2>
							
							<img src="images/me.jpg" style="width:400px;"/>
						
							<p>My name is Alex Miro Vorraro. I was born in 2001 in Sydney, where I spent my first years of life. In 2006 I moved to Naples, Italy where I lived for 14 years. I graduated from an Applied Science High School last year and just a few months ago I moved back to Sydney. So yes, that means that I speak two languages English and Italian.  At the moment I’m following the pathway for a Bachelor in IT, while I’m working part-time for a car insurance broker. One of my biggest passions is soccer. I started when I was 3 years old and I’m still playing now in Sydney for a pretty decent team. I’ve tried other sports as well, like volleyball or swimming, but soccer in my opinion in unbeatable. I have had pets my whole life, and at the moment I have two little kittens that are only a few months old. Another thing that I really enjoy is music like most people, I guess. I mainly listen to rap music and I like to explore this genre across an international spectrum.</p>

									<h2 style="color:black">When my interest for IT started, my IT experience and what interests me. </h2>
									<p style="color:black">After middle school I had to choose a senior school, and I chose an Applied Science High School which included two hours of IT per week. It wasn’t much really, but it was something new that fascinated me and sparked my passion. The thing that I most enjoyed studying was C language. Trying to find a solution to a problem was extremely interesting and stimulating. Our IT teacher had a great approach and motivated the whole class. Before we knew it, we were so involved that we would race each other to write the best code in the least time possible. His passion and knowledge inspired me to continue in this field. I then participated in an optional course of Arduino, that made me experience new things, and brought me to see how people actually worked in the sector. At the same time, my passion for videogames grew, making me get even closer to IT. Playing games for many years has allowed me to see how much this field has improved and specially made me think of how much it will change in the future.  </p>

									<h2 style="color:white;">Why I chose RMIT</h2>
									<p style="color:white;">When I came to Australia, I was determined to pursue studies in IT. After investigating my options I found a flexible, online degree through RMIT University. Friends had spoken highly of RMIT and I felt that if offered me a good study plan to suit my goals.</p>

									<p style="color:black">I expect to learn a combination of skills to enable me to have a career in the IT sector. I hope to study how to program networks, application and websites in depth and master the abilities to solve problems, design and troubleshoot. Software development and artificial intelligence interest me and I look forward to the opportunity to investigate these sectors.</p>

							<br><br><p style="color:white;">I think a job like this would be ideal for me because I would have the opportunity to utilise my scientific and mathematical skills together with my passion for programming and developing software in a team environment to design digital products that support the growth of businesses. My position would cover different aspects. I would be designing, customizing and modifying software and software systems to ensure efficiency of the customer’s business. I would be keeping the program code updated with the requirements and I would train the customer to use the tools that are available. To work in this position, I would need a Masters in IT, 10 years of experience in programming that must include at least 2 years in a lead role, the ability to work well both on my own and in a team and good communication and organizational skills. Obviously, I am not able to work in this position now and neither when I would have finished the degree. I will need to obtain a Masters in IT and get the years of experience necessary. For now, I have no experience in the IT field, but I’m a good team worker, and I have decent organization and communication skill as well. I also have other skills that might fit the position, like my good eye for detail and my analytical and logical personality. I am also always ready to learn new things, which is an important skill to fit into a new environment and progress in a field. My plan is to study hard in my undergraduate degree in order to be able to enter a Masters in IT. Hopefully in my last years of my undergraduate degree I will be able to find relevant employment and start building up my work experience in programming. After my Masters degree I would aim to eventually enter a lead role in a well-known company completing my requirements to apply for this position.</p>

							<br><br><p style="color:white;">These are the results of three online tests, a Myers-Briggs test, a learning style test and a Big Five Personality. These different tests analyse my answers to a certain number of questions to determine various things. I personally don’t like the online tests about my personality, specially, if used by employers, because I think that people can change their approach to other members or to their work in different ways, based on the situations. The results may reflect my personal lifestyle, but it’s not a result that is valid all situations. When you work, study or are doing group work, you are aware of the position you are in and you should try to make everything work in the best way, even if that means changing your style or attitude. Regarding the learning style test, I consider it quite solid, it describes my learning style well and it also gives me advise on how to improve. I often use a visual and auditory style to learn quicker and better. This test could also be helpful for a working team. They could organize their information in a way that might suit everyone’s learning style or could organize their meetings and explain their information in a simpler way for their peers. When forming a group, it is important to take into account that people have different personalities but they might modify them in a group setting, so personality might be considered initially but it is important to analyse any effects of it on the task as time progresses. </p>

									<h2 style="color:black">Overview</h2>
									<p style="color:black">The project idea that I am presenting is the development of a videogame. It is a co-op campaign with 5 people playing online together. This could be developed as a first person game or as a third person game. The game’s plot should be semirealistic, so without magical or fantastic event but with unlucky and improbable things happening. It is considerable a strategical action game. Its main target is to put all the team together with some fun gameplay that includes collaborating and coordinating attack and defence to obtain the victory of the game.</p>								</div>

									<h2>Motivation</h2>
									<p style="color:White"> Strategy games have been very popular during the years. An example is Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege that sold over 10 million copies worldwide. While the fun of playing in company of your friends in priceless. These two characteristics, added to a good and strong plot is what makes my game enjoyable and interesting. The absence of ranks instead makes this the perfect game to play when you need a break from your sweaty, try-hard game and you just want to have some fun with your friends.</p>

									<h2 style="color:black">Description</h2>
									<p style="color:black">The main features of this game are: a strong original plot, that motivates the players to see how it ends, social features, that enable group collaboration and coordination, a fun gameplay that includes a combat system and other minigames and great music that make scenes memorable
 The game starts with the selection of the available characters. Once everyone has chosen their character the story starts. The main characters meet for a few moments one night in one of the bars in the city. They all have huge amounts of debts with the same company, but nobody is aware of the other’s problems. When they return home, they all receive the same phone call from the company that lent them money telling them that there is the opportunity to cancel all their debts and actually earn some money by living and working for three months in a mine with 29 other people whilst being recorded for a tv show. Nobody really understood what that meant but they were sure that it was their opportunity to escape this dead end. When they arrive at the mine they are all amazed at seeing each other. The owner of the mine arrives and explains that their daily tasks will take more or less 16 hours and that every day of work they will receive a ticket, and at 90 tickets they will be free. They decide to work together, reducing the stress and making thing easier. After the second day the owner of the mine lets everyone notice that in the rules of the tv show it says that only half of the participants will have their debts cancelled and that if they leave now their debts will rise more than if they lose the game. After that he goes away without giving any explanation. In that moment they can’t understand how the winners were going to be chosen, but when one of the members had all of his tickets stolen the next day, they understand that war had begun. They begin to collaborate as a group to defend themselves from the other 25 members. People start betting their tickets, and this brings the user to play a few different minigames that could help win or make him lose even more tickets. The user is mainly involved in the 8 night hours that become the action time. They are supposed to defend what they have and win as many tickets as possible by organizing strategy assaults against the other groups that have formed and, including fighting and stealth moments, and defending strategies.  There is also a stamina bar that changes your speed and strength. You can restore your stamina in the training room, where you can also unlock new combat techniques if in company with someone by doing timing skill checks. This means that it is important to organize your training time as well as the rest of the activities. The game ends with a victory if all 5 can pass through the 15 winning participants. If even only one can’t pass through, the team loses.

									<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
									<p style="color:White">To develop my video game, I don’t need a big team or a huge budget like many would think. I need a game engine, like ‘Unreal’, that is intended for 3D games. This game engine if for free but there is a small percentage of royalty owned if the game’s gross if over $3000. I would then produce my own 3D models on ‘Blender’, that is also free. The minimum hardware requirements for the two software are 8gb of Ram, a Quad-core CPU and for a GPU at least an NVIDIA GeForce 470 GTX or AMD Radeon 6870 HD series card.</p>

									<h2 style="color:black">Skills Required</h2>
									<p style="color:black">There are many free video courses offered by ‘Epic Games’, the developer itself, that show you how to move within the software. This is also true for 'Blender' that is full of tutorials on Youtube that teach step by step what to do. On Unreal you can use C++ language or you can use the programming language of Unreal, ‘Blueprints’. Learning C++ shouldn’t be as difficult for me because I already know how to program in C, while learning how to create a 3D model is totally different. It takes a lot of time and experience to learn all the different necessary steps that are behind the 3D designing.</p>

									<h2>Outcome</h2>
									<p style="color:White">If the project is successful my videogame will be created and published on a store. That would mean that I would have learnt how to program and how to produce a 3D model by studying and following tutorials and well-done articles that are on the web. The next step would be to follow all the feedback that the players have sent back, check that there are no bugs in the game and if there are, resolve them. This program development and design experience would give me the skills that could be re-utilised and expanded upon in any future job. </p>
